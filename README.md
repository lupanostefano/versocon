# VersoCon 変

**Convert photos, PDFs and videos — 100% on your own machine.**

VersoCon is a desktop file converter with a real PDF editor, built for people who
don't want their documents in someone else's cloud: HEIC photos from your iPhone,
PDFs to edit and sign, scans to clean, videos to convert. Everything runs on
`127.0.0.1`, offline, with no account and no telemetry.

## Why VersoCon

- **Private by design.** Files are converted on your machine; nothing is uploaded.
  No account, no cloud, no telemetry. The session folder is removed when the app closes.
- **One app instead of five.** Photos, PDFs and video live in the same window:
  convert, edit, compress, OCR, clean scans — no subscription, no watermark, no paywall.
- **A PDF editor, not a toy.** 20 tools — watermark, redact, sign, forms, passwords,
  searchable OCR — with **live preview**: every change is shown before you apply it,
  and each result becomes the next working copy.
- **8 languages, two themes.** Switch between the Pro dashboard and the Manga theme,
  or between Italian, English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Chinese and Japanese,
  without restarting.

## What it does

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| **Photos** | HEIC / HEIF / JPG / PNG / WebP / BMP / TIFF / GIF → JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF. Batch up to 500 files, quality slider, max-side resize, animated GIFs preserved. One-click **EXIF/GPS removal** before saving. Download single files or a ZIP. |
| **PDF** | PDF → images · images → PDF · merge · split / extract pages · batch rename · compress (Low / Medium / High) · text extraction and OCR. |
| **PDF editor** | Pages: rotate, delete, reorder, insert blank, extract. Review: highlight, sticky notes, freehand ink, text, stamps. Privacy: redaction, find & replace (background and rotated text preserved). Document: watermark, Bates numbering, header/footer, PDF forms. Sign: 8 styles generated from your name (script fonts or your initials), or draw your own. Security: password protect/unprotect, searchable PDF. |
| **Scan cleanup** | Straighten tilted scans, remove shadows, adaptive black & white, 4-corner perspective crop — for both photos and scanned PDFs. |
| **Video** | Transcode to MP4 / WebM, extract audio (MP3 / M4A), export animated GIFs. Long jobs show a real progress bar with a cancel button. |
| **Comfort** | Drag & drop, keyboard navigation, WCAG-measured contrast, animated Manga theme or sober Pro theme, 8 languages. |

## Install

### Windows (recommended)

1. Download `versocon-setup-X.Y.Z.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/lupanostefano/versocon/releases/latest) and run it.
2. Or use a package manager:

```powershell
winget install HikariHasegawa.VersoCon     # official Windows package manager (live)
scoop bucket add HikariHasegawa https://github.com/lupanostefano/bucket
scoop install versocon                      # Scoop, from the author's bucket (live)
```

<details>
<summary><b>Windows shows "Windows protected your PC" — why, and what to check</b></summary>

The installer is not code-signed yet, so SmartScreen warns about any unsigned
open-source build. That is a generic caution, not a malware report.

Before you run it:
1. Verify the **SHA-256** of the downloaded file against the one on the
   [Releases page](https://github.com/lupanostefano/versocon/releases/latest)
   (v0.3.4: `658C314CC440F1AAC226DA1932EAA7C2BBAA59C8FA51965B017A8C6CECEDC1D2`).
2. Optional: upload your copy to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url).
3. If everything checks out: **More info → Run anyway / Esegui comunque**.

The full guide is in [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) (English / Italiano).

</details>

- **Linux** *(from source)*: no ready-made package yet — run `bash install.sh`. Native `.deb`/`.AppImage` builds are on the roadmap.
- **macOS** *(untested)*: the same from-source steps should work; VersoCon has not been tested on macOS yet.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lupanostefano/versocon.git
cd versocon
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Setup scripts (Windows / Linux) also install Tesseract for OCR:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1     # Windows
```

```bash
bash install.sh                                            # Linux / macOS
```

### Running

```bash
python run.py              # desktop window (pywebview), or browser if unavailable
python run.py --browser    # force the default browser
# or without pywebview:
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8321
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8321
```

## Requirements

- **Windows 10/11** for the installer; **Python 3.11+** to run from source
  (base dependencies in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)).
- **Optional engines**, detected automatically in PATH, WinGet, Chocolatey, Scoop and
  standard install folders:
  - `ffmpeg` — video conversion, audio extraction, GIF export.
  - `Tesseract` — OCR and searchable PDFs.

## Privacy and security

- The app listens only on `127.0.0.1` and validates every request (CSRF / DNS-rebinding
  protection, no path traversal); conversion never calls the network.
- The **update check is off by default**: when enabled it only asks GitHub for the latest
  version number and tells you if something newer exists.
- Output files are written to a temporary session folder and deleted when the app closes.
- Details and verification steps: [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).
